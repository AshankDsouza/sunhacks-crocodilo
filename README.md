This is a web-based simulator-documentation tool which has the key following advantages over other 

1) It will provide means to simulate designs of various systems/organizations allowing for better visualization
2) It will privide means to document system designs which offers the advantage of both zooming in and out of a system for the exact granularity needed and it also provides documentation along with simulation for better understanding of a system
3) It will provide a means to save a system design to the a database, making it possible for people to save and show their simualtion-documentation combo
4) It will allow for testing and simulation to know how good the design is
